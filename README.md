# The Iron Yard Final Project pitches

Hi. Each student in our September cohort will be submitting an individual pitch for a final project. The final projects themselves will _require_ teams of between 2 and 3 students, but everybody must do this initial pitch.

These pitches are due at midnight, Tuesday, November 22, 2016.

To submit, fork this repo, make a branch, duplicate the sample `your-name-project-name.md` file.

Change the name of that file to your values, move it into the `pitches` folder and fill it out with the suggested details of your final project idea.

Use your branch to make a pull request to this repo.

Tomorrow, we'll begin reviewing ideas and forming teams.
